                                        defines God as three divine persons or hypostases: the
                                        Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit; "one
                                        God in three persons". The three persons are distinct, yet
                                        are one "substance, essence or nature". A nature is what one
                                        is, while a person is who one is. The Trinity is considered
                                        to be a mystery of Christian faith. </div>

                                        creation myth of both Judaism and Christianity. It is made
                                        up of two parts, roughly equivalent to the first two
                                        chapters of the Book of Genesis. In the first part, Genesis
                                        1:1 through Genesis 2:3, Elohim, the generic Hebrew word for
                                        God, creates the world in six days, then rests on, blesses
                                        and sanctifies the seventh day. God creates by spoken
                                        command ("Let there be..."), suggesting a comparison with a
                                        king, who has only to speak for things to happen, and names
                                        the elements of the cosmos as he creates them</div>

                                        woman. In the Book of Genesis, chapters one through five,
                                        there are two creation narratives with two distinct
                                        perspectives on woman. In the first, Adam and Eve were
                                        created together in God's image and jointly given
                                        instructions to multiply and to be stewards over everything
                                        else that God had made. In the far more detailed second
                                        narrative, God fashions Adam from dust and places him in the
                                        Garden of Eden where he is to have dominion over the plants

                                        humanity's state of sin resulting from the fall of man,
                                        stemming from Adam's rebellion in Eden. This condition has
                                        been characterized in many ways, ranging from something as
                                        insignificant as a slight deficiency, or a tendency toward
                                        sin yet without collective guilt, referred to as a "sin
                                        nature", to something as drastic as total depravity or
                                        automatic guilt of all humans through collective guilt.

                                        myth in the Hebrew Bible, comprising chapters 6-9 in the
                                        Book of Genesis. The narrative indicates that the God of
                                        Israel intended to return the universe to its pre-Creation
                                        state of watery chaos and then remake it using the microcosm
                                        of Noah's ark. Thus, the flood was no ordinary overflow but
                                        a reversal of creation. The narrative discusses the evil of
                                        humanity that moved God to destroy their universe by way of
                                        the flood, the preparation of the ark for certain animals,
                                        and for Noah and his family, and God's guarantee for the
                                        continued existence of life under the promise that he would
                                        never send another flood. </div>

                                        Shem, Ham and Japheth. In his six hundredth year God,
                                        saddened at the wickedness of mankind, sent a great deluge
                                        to destroy all life, but because Noah was "righteous in his
                                        generation" God instructed him to build an ark and save a
                                        remnant of life. After the Flood, Noah offered a sacrifice

                                        was born in a time when his people, the Children of Israel,
                                        were increasing in numbers and the Egyptian Pharaoh was
                                        worried that they might help Egypt's enemies. Moses' Hebrew
                                        mother, Jochebed, hid him when the Pharaoh ordered all
                                        newborn Hebrew boys to be killed, and the child was adopted
                                        as a foundling by the Egyptian royal family. After killing
                                        an Egyptian slavemaster, Moses fled across the Red Sea to
                                        Midian, where he encountered the God of Israel in the form
                                        of a "burning bush". God sent Moses back to Egypt to request
                                        the release of the Israelites. After the Ten Plagues, Moses
                                        led the Exodus of the Israelites out of Egypt and across the
                                        Red Sea, after which they based themselves at Mount Sinai,
                                        where Moses received the Ten Commandments. After 40 years of
                                        wandering in the desert, Moses died within sight of the
                                        Promised Land. </div>

                                        Mary's life with the Annunciation, when the angel Gabriel
                                        appeared to her and announced her divine selection to be the
                                        mother of Jesus. Church tradition and the Gospel of James AD
                                        145 state that her parents were an elderly couple, Saint
                                        Joachim and Saint Anne. The Bible records Mary's role in key
                                        events of the life of Jesus from his conception to his
                                        Ascension. Apocryphal writings tell of her subsequent death
                                        and bodily assumption into heaven. Christians of the
                                        Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental
                                        Orthodox Church, Anglican Communion, and Lutheran churches
                                        believe that Mary, as mother of Jesus, is the Mother of God
                                        and the Theotokos, literally "Bearer of God". Mary has been
                                        venerated since Early Christianity. Throughout the ages she
                                        has been a favorite subject in Christian art, music, and

                                        Nativity, refers to the accounts of the birth of Jesus,
                                        primarily based on the two accounts in the gospels of Luke
                                        and Matthew, and secondarily on some apocryphal texts. The
                                        word is anglicized from Latin De nativitate Iesu, a section
                                        title in the Vulgate. The canonical gospels of Luke and
                                        Matthew describe Jesus being born in Bethlehem, in Judea, to
                                        a virgin mother. Luke features the Christmas story, in which
                                        Joseph and Mary, as part of a census, travel to Bethlehem,
                                        where Jesus is born and laid in a manger. Angels proclaim
                                        him a savior for all people, and shepherds come to adore
                                        him. In Matthew, wise men follow a star to Bethlehem to
                                        bring gifts to Jesus, born the King of the Jews. King Herod
                                        massacres all the toddler boys in Bethlehem to kill Jesus,
                                        but the family flees to Egypt and later settles in
                                        Nazareth.</div>

                                        conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, performed
                                        miracles, founded the Church, died sacrificially by
                                        crucifixion to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and
                                        ascended into heaven, from which he will return. The
                                        majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of
                                        God the Son, who is the Second Person of the Holy

                                        Christian churches, normally carried out through anointing,
                                        the laying on of hands, and prayer, for the purpose of
                                        bestowing the Gift of the Holy Spirit. In Christianity,
                                        confirmation is seen as the sealing of the covenant made in
                                        Holy Baptism. Confirmation "renders the bond with the Church
                                        more perfect", because a baptized person is already a full
                                        member.Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox
                                        Churches, and many Anglicans view Confirmation as a
                                        sacrament. In the East it is conferred immediately after
                                        baptism. In the West, this practice is followed when adults
                                        are baptized, but in the case of infants not in danger of
                                        death it is administered, ordinarily by a bishop, only when
                                        the child reaches the age of reason or early adolescence.
                                        Among those Catholics who practice teen-aged confirmation,
                                        the practice may be perceived, secondarily, as a "coming of
                                        age" rite.</div>

                                        Christian sacrament or ordinance. It is reenacted in

                                        recorded in several books of the New Testament, that his
                                        followers do in remembrance of Him as when he gave his
                                        disciples bread, saying, "This is my body", and gave them
                                        wine saying, "This is my blood." Roman Catholicism, Eastern
                                        Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, and the Church of the East
                                        teach that the reality (the "substance") of the elements of
                                        bread and wine is wholly changed into the body and blood of

                                        Transubstantiation is the term used by Roman Catholics to

                                        transformation occurs, since the Catholic Church teaches
                                        that "the signs of bread and wine become, in a way

                                        Penance is the method of the Church by which individual men
                                        and women may confess sins committed after baptism and have
                                        them absolved by a priest. Although it is not mandatory, the
                                        Catholic rite is usually conducted within a confessional
                                        box, booth or reconciliation room. This sacrament is known
                                        by many names, including penance, reconciliation and
                                        confession. While official Church publications always refer
                                        to the sacrament as "Penance", "Reconciliation" or "Penance
                                        and Reconciliation", many laypeople continue to use the term
                                        "Confession" in reference to the Sacrament. For the Catholic
                                        Church, the intent of this sacrament is to provide healing
                                        for the soul as well as to regain the grace of God, lost by
                                        sin. It is the only ordinary way to receive the forgiveness
                                        of God for serious (mortal) sins which if unforgiven condemn
                                        a person to Hell. The Church teaches that Catholic priests
                                        have been given the authority by God to exercise the
                                        forgiveness of sins here on earth and it is in God's Name by
                                        which the person confessing is forgiven. In theological
                                        terms, the priest acts in persona Christi and receives from
                                        the Church the power of jurisdiction over the
                                        penitent.</div>

                                        spouses and the procreation and education of offspring. It
                                        has been raised by Christ the Lord to the dignity of a
                                        sacrament between the baptised." In the Roman Rite, it is
                                        ordinarily celebrated in a Nuptial Mass. Marriage is
                                        recognized in the New Testament scriptures, in the words of
                                        Jesus and of Saint Paul regarding the sacred and divine
                                        state of marriage. Jesus forbade divorce and stated that in
                                        the state of marriage "the two become one flesh". Saint Paul
                                        wrote one of the most often quoted descriptions of the
                                        proper behavior of spouses in the ideal sacramental marriage
                                        in the New Testament book of Ephesians, Chapter 5,
                                        referencing the words of Jesus. Many theologians and early
                                        Church fathers have observed that the first recorded miracle
                                        of Jesus is at a wedding feast, thus, many believe,
                                        signifying his approval of the institution of marriage as
                                        well as his recognition of the importance of the public
                                        celebration of a wedding.</div>

                                        Roman Catholic (Latin: sacri ordines) churche Holy Orders
                                        comprise the three orders of bishop, priest and deacon, or
                                        the sacrament or rite by which candidates are ordained to
                                        those orders. The churche regards ordination as a sacrament
                                        (the sacramentum ordinis). The ministerial orders of the
                                        Catholic Church include the orders of bishops, deacons and
                                        presbyters, which in Latin is sacerdos. The ordained

                                        having reached the age of reason, begins to be in danger due
                                        to sickness or old age", except in the case of those who
                                        "persevere obstinately in manifest grave sin". Proximate
                                        danger of death, the occasion for the administration of
                                        Viaticum, is not required, but only the onset of a medical
                                        condition considered to be a possible prelude to death. The
                                        sacrament is also referred to as Unction, and in the past as
                                        Extreme Unction, and it is one of the three sacraments that
                                        constitute the Last Rites (together with the Sacrament of
                                        Penance and Viaticum). The sacrament is administered by a
                                        priest, who uses olive oil or another pure plant oil to
                                        anoint the patient's forehead and perhaps other parts of the
                                        body while reciting certain prayers. It is believed to give
                                        comfort, peace, courage and, if the sick person is unable to
                                        make a confession, even forgiveness of sins. </div>

                                        Heaven as a place of eternal life and the dwelling place of
                                        Angels and the Throne of God. In most Christian
                                        denominations, belief in the afterlife is professed in the
                                        major creeds, such as the Nicene Creed, which states: "We
                                        look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the
                                        world to come." In the Christian Bible, concepts about the
                                        future "Kingdom of Heaven" are also professed in several
                                        scriptural prophecies of the new (or renewed) Earth said to
                                        follow the resurrection of the dead—particularly the books
                                        of Isaiah and Revelation and other sources of Christian
                                        eschatology. The resurrected Jesus is said to have ascended
                                        to heaven where he now sits at the Right Hand of God and
                                        will return to earth in the Second Coming. Mary, his mother,
                                        according to Catholic (Christianity's largest denomination)
                                        tradition is also said to have been assumed into heaven and
                                        is titled the Queen of Heaven. </div>

                                        it to be place or a state in which the souls of the damned
                                        suffer the consequences of their sins. Hell is generally
                                        defined as the eternal fate of unrepentant sinners after
                                        this life. Hell's character is inferred from biblical
                                        teaching, which has often been understood literally. Souls
                                        are said to pass into hell by God's irrevocable judgment,
                                        either immediately after death (particular judgment) or in
                                        the general judgment. Modern theologians generally describe
                                        hell as the logical consequence of the soul using its free
                                        will to reject union with God. It is considered compatible
                                        with God's justice and mercy because God will not interfere
                                        with the soul's free choice.</div>

                                        grace are believed to be made ready for the Beatific Vision
                                        in Heaven. Only one who dies in a state of grace can be in
                                        Purgatory, and therefore no one who is in Purgatory will
                                        remain there forever or go to Hell. This theological notion
                                        has ancient roots and is well-attested in early Christian
                                        literature, but the poetic conception of Purgatory as a
                                        geographically existing place is largely the creation of
                                        medieval Christian piety and imagination.</div>
